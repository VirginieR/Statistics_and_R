# Random Variables 

# Imagine that we actually have the weight of all control female mice and can upload them to R. 
# In Statistics, we refer to this as the population. 
# These are all the control mice available from which we sampled 24. 
# Note that in practice we do not have access to the population. 
# We have a special data set that we are using here to illustrate concepts.
